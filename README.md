# Leaflet/Shiny Map
This code describes a method for creating a simple Leaflet map in R and creating a Shiny App from it. The example used here is for a map of parking restrictions in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago. The map visualizes the streets shapefile by colors in terms of parking restrictiveness (green = least restrictive, red = most), and also adds a button to the final map that allows a user to geolocate themselves (the map zooms to their location when clicked). The basemap is the standard OSM tiles. The same general code structure can be used to include polygon or point shapefiles. The raw html (including javascirpt) can be published on Rpubs (or exported for your own web use), or the Shiny App can be exported to Shiny Server for online distribution.
